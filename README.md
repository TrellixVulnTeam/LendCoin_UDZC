# LendCoin
Easy lending and borrowing with little hassle!

Built from scratch, LendCoin is designed with lenders and borrowers in mind. Getting started is as easy as visiting our website, lend-coin.net, and creating a public and private key. These will help identify you on our blockchain as well as verifying your transactions. The blockchain was built from the ground up to be safe and secure, and uses both SHA-512 and RSA-2048 encryption algorithms to make sure money is not stolen during transfer. The lending process in the blockchain takes just minutes, so you don't have to wait for days for the money to be lent to you. This ultimately leads to happier lenders and happier borrowers. 

Technical details:
Blockchain is the form of our line of credit. There is a genesis block of a set number of coins, and to gain coins one must lend out some of what is available. Like many blockchains, a public transaction history is available. If the borrower ends up defaulting on his or her loan, a negative balance is applied to his or her account, and they may not borrow until the debt is paid off. Being a blockchain, the method of transferring money is through a peer-to-peer network, where blocks are transferred and stored from one client to another. LendCoin has a web front-end, on which to process lending orders. This blockchain is verified through a combination of proof of work and proof of stake; that is, a borrower can earn money by either mining or having more coins. This lessens the burden of debt on the debtor, as computer verification of blocks is sufficient to earn some money to pay the lender back.
